# Qt 6 Help tutorial walkthrough qualification

## Scope and current state — 2026-10-02

The user requested this as the next qualification phase after the current Linux
replacement work: follow the Help tutorials as a person using GMAT would, build
the scenarios through the Qt application, and establish that the GUI can complete
them. Shipped tutorial mission scripts are reserved for comparison afterward.
This extends the existing goal; it does not replace its unfinished acceptance
requirements. Windows, macOS and MATLAB remain deferred.

**All twelve published tutorials are Passed for bounded private actual-input construction.** See
[Tutorial 1](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-01-20261002.md),
[Tutorial 2](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-02-20261002.md),
[Tutorial 3](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-03-20261002.md),
[Tutorial 4](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-04-20261002.md) and
[Tutorial 5](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-05-20261002.md),
[Tutorial 6](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-06-20261002.md),
[Tutorial 7](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-07-20261002.md) and
[Tutorial 8](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-08-20261002.md) and
[Tutorial 9](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-09-20261002.md),
[Tutorial 10](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-10-20261002.md) and
[Tutorial 11](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-11-20261002.md) and
[Tutorial 12](Qt6ParityValidation/help-tutorial-12-20261002.md). Each includes
independent Help-driven construction, execution and result checks, save/reopen,
and comparison after freezing the authored mission. Tutorial 4 covers resource
and command forms, B-plane targeting and Mars capture. Its resource fixes have
[focused evidence](Qt6ParityValidation/tutorial-resource-fixes-20261002.md).
Tutorial 5 covers all five Help-taught code-editor stages. Its original Step 5
sample reproduced a line-search failure; appending a nominal Stage 4 starting
guess preserves its physics and constraints and passes one changed-reference GUI
verification. The frozen own construction preceded all new reference access.
Tutorials 10–11 complete DSN/GN estimation and GPS simulation/filter/smoother,
warm start, covariance/plots, ephemeris/prediction and Linux console workflows.
The shared residual-plot data-loss repair is verified through the affected
actual GUI stages. Tutorial 12 retains its frozen literal original walkthrough
and separately verifies the reviewed tracking-frame repair. The installed
offline Help is rebuilt with that correction. Tutorial 6 completes functions, Global sharing and Mars capture. Tutorial 8 independently passed electric hardware/finite-burn forms
and matched the corrected reference summary. Tutorial 7 completes its core
eclipse/contact workflow, with optional exercises and GUI LSK management
unclaimed. The earlier shipped-script corpus
and repairs are not GUI walkthrough evidence.
The current runtime is in `/home/dan/GIT/GMAT-Qt/application/bin`. Live testing on
the user's desktop remains stopped following the GNOME Shell crash. A private,
authenticated X11/software-GL route with actual mouse/keyboard input is now
established; see [isolated input evidence](Qt6ParityValidation/isolated-x11-input-20261002.md).
It can support independent GUI construction while host GNOME/Wayland, portals
and hardware-driver acceptance remain open. Offscreen fixtures do not substitute
for interactive construction. All twelve tutorials used that bounded route through
actual Help/resource/mission controls or the expressly Help-taught code editor,
with separate per-chapter evidence. These passes do not close the host desktop
or full Linux replacement gates.

The published order comes from `doc/help/src/Part_Tutorials.xml`; prerequisite
notes below come from the chapter introductions. Use the Help actually available
from the application when walking through it, recording missing/stale chapters
or links against the source. Reading an inventory is not a completed tutorial.

## Construction and comparison procedure

1. Start a new mission with the application's normal defaults. Where a chapter
   extends an earlier tutorial, use the mission independently built during that
   earlier walkthrough. Do not open, copy, insert or programmatically seed the
   shipped tutorial mission to construct the scenario. If the Help starts by
   loading an example, reproduce its configuration from the written instructions;
   insufficient instructions are a documented Help gap.
2. Follow the chapter's steps in order using visible resource editors, mission
   controls, plots and output. Enter the settings through the UI. Save a concise
   action record with chapter/step references, screenshots where useful, resource
   settings and branch/command structure. Engine API calls, generated scripts and
   model-setter test fixtures do not substitute for interactive construction.
3. Use the application's script/function editor when the chapter explicitly
   teaches authoring code, entering the chapter's instructions independently.
   Record script-editor steps separately from resource/mission editor coverage.
   A missing Qt control is a concrete capability finding: implement reasonable
   gaps in the authorized Linux scope and retry the affected step. Do not silently
   bypass missing GUI functionality with a prebuilt reference script.
4. Required observations, kernels, function support files and other inputs
   expressly called for by the Help are declared dependencies. Record their
   provenance and identity. Their use does not authorize importing reference
   mission/resource configuration. Preserve generated data needed by later
   chapters. Missing public inputs remain open findings; deferred/proprietary
   dependencies require an explicit, evidence-backed disposition.
5. Run each independently authored scenario and inspect the specified reports,
   plots, targets and tolerances. Save/reopen it and confirm that the constructed
   settings and mission sequence survive. For staged tutorials, preserve each
   milestone and distinguish intentional Stops from completed solves.
6. Before consulting the shipped mission script, preserve the authored mission,
   its hash, action record, runtime/build identity and outputs. Then compare
   resource settings, mission logic and numerical/visual results to the reference.
   Explain substantive differences; formatting, ordering and Qt metadata alone
   do not establish a failure. Previous exposure during corpus qualification is
   disclosed; the walkthrough must still be independently driven by the Help.
7. Record each outcome as pending, in progress, passed, failed, or blocked, with
   the exact failed step or dependency and bounded evidence. A pass requires
   successful interactive construction, execution, the chapter's result checks,
   save/reopen and the final comparison. Avoid repeating unchanged successful
   tests or expensive reference runs when existing compatible evidence suffices.

## Published tutorial sequence

All twelve published tutorials are **Passed** with the bounded evidence linked

Original authored source preserved; scientific/host/full replacement limits explicit. |

Chapters 9, 10 and 12 describe legacy script-only navigation workflows. Chapter 5
also requires authoring an optimization sequence. Record what the Qt resource and
mission controls can actually construct, and identify remaining script-editor
boundaries; successful backend execution alone is not GUI capability coverage.
The local optional VF13ad component has previous execution evidence, which does
not establish tutorial 5's interactive workflow.

## Additional source tutorials

These twelve source chapters are absent from the current Tutorials table of
contents and have no installed chapter pages. The [availability audit](Qt6ParityValidation/help-extra-chapters-20261002.md)
records the exact book/files and all 195 image references. Keep them separate
from the twelve published chapters: no additional walkthrough is passed.
MATLAB/fmincon chapters are deferred; contradictory/legacy optimizer identities
remain unresolved. Creating a Report, Force Models and LEO Station Keeping are
potential additional coverage. Earlier repairs/execution of these chapters do
not satisfy independent interactive construction.

| Chapter source | Additional or legacy chapter |
|---|---|
| `Tut_ACEStationKeeping.xml` | ACE Station Keeping |
| `Tut_AlgebraicOptimization.xml` | Algebraic Optimization |
| `Tut_CreatingReport.xml` | Creating a Report |
| `Tut_ForceModels.xml` | Force Models |
| `Tut_FormationRendezvous.xml` | Formation Rendezvous |
| `Tut_L2Transfer.xml` | L2 Transfer with Swingby |
| `Tut_LEOStationKeeping.xml` | LEO Station Keeping |
| `Tut_LunarTransfer.xml` | Lunar Transfer |
| `Tut_MATLAB.xml` | Running GMAT Scripts from MATLAB — deferred |
| `Tut_MarsB-PlaneTargeting.xml` | Older Mars B-Plane Targeting chapter |
| `Tut_MinFuelLunarTransfer.xml` | Minimum Fuel for Lunar Transfer |
| `Tut_MinFuelOrbitTransfer.xml` | Minimum Fuel for Orbit Transfer |

For each actual walkthrough, add a per-chapter record under
`doc/DevelopersDocs/Qt6ParityValidation` and link it here. Preserve raw artifacts
in the ignored qualification artifact tree. All twelve published tutorials have completed
records linked above. Additional source chapters retain the separate
availability/dependency disposition and have no completed walkthrough claim.
