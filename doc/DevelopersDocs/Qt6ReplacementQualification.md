# Linux Qt replacement qualification: workflows, viewers, plugins and files

Status: in progress. This is the acceptance checklist for requested areas 3, 4,
and 5. Existing milestone tests do not establish full replacement qualification.
Windows/macOS deployment is deferred. MATLAB is outside the selected Linux
runtime; supported plugins below come from its actual startup configuration.

## Acceptance gates

- [ ] Audit each wx workflow below against Qt; implement missing user operations
      and record executable evidence. Shared generic controls can serve a workflow
      only when all its operations and validation are available.
- [ ] Array resizing and expression-valued cell editing with cancel, rollback,
      undo and calculation-preserving save/reopen.
- [ ] Resource reference selection, dependent settings, specialized spacecraft,
      force-model, propagation, coordinate-system, hardware and output workflows.
- [ ] Mission commands and branch editing through controls, preserving labels,
      comments, nested commands and unsupported syntax.
- [ ] Plotting option/callback audit, native and fallback correctness, replay,
      camera tracking and output lifecycle checks.
- [ ] OF conversion: perspective/FOV, multiple views, trajectory-relative and
      body-relative camera modes; preserve settings or explicitly diagnose an
      unresolved case. A warning alone does not count as implemented parity.
- [ ] Each selected plugin: configuration, execution, expected numerical/report
      result and error recovery through Qt, with fixture requirements recorded.
- [ ] Script round trips preserve calculations, expressions, unknown settings,
      comments and references; save/reopen, Save As, undo and failed-edit recovery.
- [ ] Rebuild the actual application/bin/GmatQt and pass relevant regression tests.

## Implementation checkpoint 1

Added command controls for For, If/While, assignments, Toggle and Global/Clear.
Header edits preserve nested source. Actual engine-normalized If headers omit
semicolons; both forms are covered. Tests execute changed loop/condition values
and verify Undo restores the original numerical result.

Array grids now resize: retained cells survive, new cells are zero, shrinking
removes cropped cells only from the dialog until accepted. Apply reconstructs
and validates the mission; Undo restores dimensions and values. Non-array
vector/matrix dimensions remain fixed. Expression cells are still pending.

All 11 Qt tests passed (18.70 seconds), including the new workflow assertions;
see `Qt6ParityValidation/check-qualification-1.txt`. This checkpoint does not
close any of the three requested qualification areas.

## Plugin/file checkpoint

The function, optimizer and eclipse fixtures now save, Save As to a Unicode
filename, deliberately fail interpretation, reopen and rebuild the saved script,
and only then run their numerical/report checks. Both saved files must match
the edited script exactly. The targeted compatibility test passed; see
`Qt6ParityValidation/plugin-roundtrip.txt`. This establishes these workflows,
not qualification of the remaining plugin inventory.

## Reference-picker and plugin checkpoint

Resource properties now offer file browsing and engine-typed scalar/list
reference selection. Ordered lists retain current members first (including
existing names absent from the offered set), support drag reordering and do not
apply until Apply. Tests cover tank order/mixture ratios, Cancel, pending state,
EarthFixed selection and choosing a new output filename without creating it.
Free text remains available for parameter expressions and plugin-defined types.

Qualification exposed the missing Formation.Add editor. It now accepts only
existing spacecraft and supports reconstruction through the normal undoable
Apply path. The compatibility test verifies member reordering, rejection of a
propagator as a member, exact file round trips and actual 60-second propagation
of both spacecraft. The shipped Python interface example also runs after file
round trips/recovery, with an independently calculated cross product and report.
These results expand evidence; the remaining plugin and viewer gates stay open.

The rebuilt Linux application passed all 11 tests in 19.07 seconds; evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-qualification-2.txt`.

## XY viewer control checkpoint

Qt now exposes its implemented XY styles through a Style dialog. Each curve has
its own controls, and changing the selected curve retains other pending edits.
OK applies; Cancel changes neither model nor pixels. Color/marker changes update
existing samples as well as the curve defaults. Styles are session-local and
are reset by rebuilding the mission; the dialog states that scope explicitly.

PlotTests verifies canceled edits preserve the captured image, accepted edits
change the image and selected curve, and another curve stays unchanged. The
same fixture runs under software-native and HiDPI configurations. Source audit
also confirmed wx ignores the index argument for ChangeWidth/ChangeStyle
(`GuiPlotReceiver.cpp`); Qt's whole-curve behavior matches that baseline.
Camera projection, multiple views and OF-relative camera conversion remain open.

All 11 tests passed in 19.53 seconds and GmatQt was rebuilt; evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-xy-style.txt`.

## Perspective camera checkpoint

Added interactive perspective projection and vertical FOV controls while keeping
orthographic as the default. Native rendering uses a perspective frustum;
fallback projection applies depth scaling and rejects objects behind the eye.
The fallback pan offset uses the camera plane, and native labels use clip-space
bounds rather than drawing labels behind the camera. Perspective sky geometry
uses the camera FOV/zoom and remains translation invariant.

Native tests cover FOV framing, depth-dependent body size, behind-camera
clipping, exact orthographic restoration and star translation/zoom behavior.
PlotTests exercises the actual projection/FOV controls and rendered changes in
both fallback and native/HiDPI configurations. OF FOV import, persistent camera
settings, multiple views and relative camera modes are still open; interactive
projection alone does not satisfy those conversion requirements.

All 11 tests passed in 20.90 seconds; GmatQt was rebuilt. Evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-perspective.txt`.

## OpenFrames projection import checkpoint

The converter now imports the first selected OF view's perspective projection
and FOVy (default 45 degrees), preserving fractional angles. Settings are stored
in a `% GMAT-Qt-Camera` JSON comment, so the base engine can still interpret the
converted calculations. Qt validates plot names, booleans, finite FOV from 1 to
150 degrees and duplicate directives before using them. Invalid or unsupported
FOV is rejected rather than clamped during conversion.

Receiver-created orbit models get these settings before their widgets are
created. GUI reconstruction retains directives when engine serialization omits
them. Tests cover defaults, fractional FOV, invalid values, duplicate directives,
the real Hohmann renderer model, resource edit/Undo, and save/reopen/run. This
closes basic OF perspective/FOV import, but not multiple-view selection, relative
orientation, or saving camera changes made with the interactive controls.

Rebuilt GmatQt and passed all 11 tests in 20.59 seconds; evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-fov-import.txt`.

## Interactive projection persistence checkpoint

OrbitView now has Keep projection. It adds/replaces that plot's validated camera
comment as one undoable editor change and updates the built-source snapshot,
without interpreting the mission or deleting the viewer during its callback.
The file is not written until the normal Save action. Running missions, unbuilt
script edits, pending panel edits and missing/non-OrbitView resources are rejected.

WorkflowTests exercises the actual toolbar action, fractional FOV, switching to
orthographic, repeated clicks without duplicate directives, unchanged mission
sequence, unchanged engine object identity, Undo/Redo, protection of unbuilt
edits, and save/reopen/run restoration. This closes projection/FOV persistence;
manual orbit angles/pan/zoom, multiple views and relative camera modes are still
outstanding, alongside the other workflow and plugin qualification gates.

GmatQt rebuilt; all 11 tests passed in 20.17 seconds. Evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-keep-projection.txt`.

## Expression-cell checkpoint

Added an Expressions grid to Array resources. General formulas are GMAT mission
commands, so new formula blocks initialize cells at mission start in row order;
the dialog states this timing explicitly. Numeric initial values stay separate.
Formula blocks preserve text across Apply, Undo/Redo and save/reopen. Existing
mission assignments remain untouched. Unrecognized statements inside a managed
block are refused instead of erased; invalid cells/formulas restore the previous
mission. Resource editing now preserves the original mission section verbatim.

WorkflowTests opens the grid, exercises Cancel and Apply, evaluates dependent
cells to an independently expected result, verifies Undo/Redo, unrelated resource
editing, save/reopen and reopened grid text, clears formulas and undoes that,
and verifies extra commands/unknown references are rejected without changing
source or runtime results. Numeric and expression edits currently require
separate Apply operations; arbitrary existing assignments use Mission editing.
The remaining specialized-editor, multi-camera and plugin gates stay open.

GmatQt rebuilt; all 11 tests passed in 21.53 seconds. Evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-array-expressions.txt`.


## Propagator plugin checkpoint

Resource panels now enumerate writable fields of a PropSetup's owned propagator,
including plugin settings hidden by the parent forwarding table. Edits target the
owned object. Resource serialization excludes the separately written force model
when matching propagator blocks; previously numerical-propagator Apply could fail
with the specialized-editor message despite having a supported property.

CompatibilityTests runs the shipped TLE mission, checks a one-day report span,
finite low-Earth-orbit state and matching spacecraft epoch, edits sampling from
300 to 120 seconds, verifies endpoint invariance, and recovers from a missing TLE
file without changing the result. BulirschStoer and PrinceDormand853 each undergo
step editing, exact save/Save As/reopen and invalid-build recovery, then propagate
a circular point-mass Earth orbit against an analytic endpoint within 0.1 metre.
Both produce reports. These checks qualify these scenarios, not every plugin
option or propagation regime. Specialized workflows and other inventory gaps
remain open.

The user's GmatQt executable was rebuilt. All 11 Qt tests passed in 21.91 seconds.
Evidence: `Qt6ParityValidation/check-plugin-propagators.txt`.


## Camera roll checkpoint

OF conversion now preserves the selected view's arbitrary up vector in validated
Qt camera metadata. The receiver applies it in ViewUpCoordinateSystem to every
camera-history sample, so playback uses the same roll as propagation. A nearest
standard axis remains in the script as a base-viewer fallback. Invalid and zero
vectors are rejected instead of approximated. Keep projection preserves the
vector; an explicit resource-panel ViewUpAxis edit removes that override.

WorkflowTests covers exact non-axis conversion, invalid metadata, real Hohmann
propagation with an arbitrary up vector at the first and last camera frames,
resource-edit retention, save/reopen, Keep projection retention, explicit axis
override, and Undo restoring the imported vector. Multiple-view switching and
body-/trajectory-relative orientation remain pending; this closes the arbitrary
up-vector approximation only.

GmatQt rebuilt; all 11 Qt tests passed in 31.38 seconds. Evidence:
`Qt6ParityValidation/check-camera-up.txt`.


## Multiple-camera checkpoint

Conversion now retains the full ordered OF View list as a first standard
OrbitView camera plus named Qt camera definitions. Each additional view has
projection/FOV, eye/center/up vectors, reference and target objects. Qt validates
all views and references before execution. The receiver records bounded histories
for each view and clears them on mission/solver reset. The camera selector uses
those histories for replay and does not reinterpret or rerun the mission.
Keep projection edits the selected view only, preserving the others.

WorkflowTests covers stored Current camera vectors, malformed secondary views,
the shipped Hohmann three-view list, per-frame Earth/spacecraft tracking,
replay basis changes, unchanged mission object identity/frame count on selection,
independent projection settings, save/reopen, invalid-reference build rejection
and recovery. PlotTests verifies visible switching and exact restoration in both
fallback and native/HiDPI renderers, plus history cleanup. Existing resource edits
and Undo retain the full camera metadata.

This implements named view switching and translation tracking. Body-relative
rotation, trajectory/segment views and original automatic framing remain open.
The current unstored-location fallback is explicitly reported as 30000 km; it is
not counted as OF automatic-framing parity. Base viewer compatibility retains
the first camera; additional definitions are Qt comments.

The user executable was rebuilt; all 11 Qt tests passed in 22.99 seconds.
Evidence: `Qt6ParityValidation/check-multiple-cameras.txt`.


## Body-relative camera checkpoint

Primary and additional OF views now retain the InertialFrame mode. With that
setting Off and ViewTrajectory Off, their eye offsets, center offsets and up
vectors rotate with the reference object's attitude into the plot coordinate
system. Celestial and spacecraft attitude conventions are handled separately.
InertialFrame On retains position tracking with plot-frame axes. Primary center
offsets are retained, and an explicit ViewDirection edit clears that override.
Validation rejects incompatible primary reference/eye types before execution.

WorkflowTests checks the primary Earth camera against independent EarthFixed
coordinate conversions, including nonzero center and non-axis up vectors at the
first and last samples, both in inertial and rotating plot frames. Additional
Earth and spinning-spacecraft views match the recorded body orientation and
position histories. Save/reopen retains the poses; incompatible reference edits
are rejected and the previous mission reruns unchanged. Conversion also verifies
InertialFrame On and rejects malformed primary stored vectors.

Trajectory/segment views, two-frame look-at ShortestAngle/AZEL orientation and
original automatic framing remain pending. These cases retain explicit conversion
notes and are not counted as completed parity.

The user executable was rebuilt; all 11 Qt tests passed in 24.63 seconds.
Evidence: `Qt6ParityValidation/check-body-cameras.txt`.
